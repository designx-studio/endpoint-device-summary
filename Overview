System Health Dashboard Generator (PowerShell)
What is this?
Ever wish you had a simple, one-click report that tells you exactly how your Windows machine is doing? This PowerShell script does just that!

It runs a quick checkup on your computer's hardware, security, and network, then spits out a beautiful, color-coded HTML dashboard that you can open in any web browser. No more digging through multiple Windows menus!

Key Features
The report runs deep checks and gives you actionable recommendations if it finds a problem.

Overall Health Status: Get a single, easy-to-read rating (HEALTHY, WARNING, or CRITICAL).

Disk Integrity: Checks for dangerously low disk space and predictive drive failure warnings (SMART status).

Security Posture: Confirms if BitLocker is active, if the TPM chip is ready, and if Windows Defender Real-Time Protection is running.

System Stability: Looks at the system event logs for any critical crashes or errors that happened in the last 24 hours.

Connectivity: Pings external services like Azure and a reliable DNS (like Google's 8.8.8.8) to verify network access.

Battery Wear: Provides a basic calculation of how much your laptop battery has degraded (based on design vs. current capacity, if available).
